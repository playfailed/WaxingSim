## About The Project

WaxingSim is a tool built to emulate the waxing and beequip mechanics found in Bee Swarm Simulator, making it easier to understand how the system behaves under different conditions. You can access this app via this link [here]().

The project focuses on clarity, transparency, and accurate modelling of the game’s underlying probabilities.

This project uses node js and plotly.js for it's dependencies.

## Features

* Step-by-step logging that shows exactly how each wax or beequip action is processed.

* Plotly-based visual grids to illustrate the low-probability nature of beequip stat rolls and upgrade chances.

* Adaptive spreadsheets that give a detailed breakdown of possible stats and outcomes.

* Wax mechanics that closely mirror the behaviour seen in the game.
